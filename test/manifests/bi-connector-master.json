These tools expect to connect to a data\nsource and find data in tabular form following a fixed schema. This\npresents a challenge when working with MongoDB\u2019s\nflexible schema and rich,\nmulti-dimensional documents.\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI acts as a layer that passes queries and\ndata between a mongod or mongos instance and your\nreporting tool. The MongoDB Connector for BI stores no data, and purely serves to bridge your\nMongoDB server with business intelligence tools.\n\n\n\n\nNew in Version 2.2\u00b6\n\nAuthentication Plugins\u00b6\nMongoDB Connector for BI Version 2.0 introduced passthrough authentication,\nin which clients authenticate as a user defined in MongoDB, without\nthe need to create a separate user within the connector itself.\nMongoDB Connector for BI Version 2.2 further increases ease of use with\na set of authentication plugins which can authenticate users\nthrough the connector without the need for SSL certificates.\nThese plugins perform user authentication via the SASL framework\nand support the SCRAM-SHA-1 and PLAIN authentication mechanisms.\nWe currently provide authentication plugins in the following languages:\n\nJava - for use with\nMySQL\u2019s Connector/J driver\nC - for use with the MySQL ODBC\ndriver and the MySQL Shell\n\n\n\n\nNew in Version 2.0\u00b6\n\nImproved Server-Side Execution\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI delivers significant performance and scalability improvements\nby moving as much execution as possible to the underlying MongoDB\ninstance. Pushing execution down to the server reduces network\nlatency and reduces bandwidth consumption.\nThis approach also reduces memory and CPU consumption in the MongoDB Connector for BI itself.\n\n\nPass-through Authentication\u00b6\nThe user authentication process is now passed through the MongoDB Connector for BI to the\nunderlying MongoDB instance. Users now authenticate as a user already\ncreated within MongoDB.\n\n\nSimplified Architecture\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI package is now trimmed down from four separate components to\ntwo:\n\nmongodrdl\nThis tool connects to a MongoDB instance and\ngenerates a Document-Relational Definition Language (DRDL)\nfile, which maps a given collection shape to relational schema.\nmongosqld\nOnce installed and run as a daemon,\nmongosqld responds to SQL queries, requests for DB\ninformation, and schema from the requesting BI tool via the MySQL\nwire protocol.\nmongosqld requires at least one Document Relational Definition Language file to start.\nYou will need to have defined your schema with\nmongodrdl before starting mongosqld.\n\n\n\n\nSQL Compatibility\u00b6\nMongoDB Connector for BI Version 2.x is compatible with SQL-99 SELECT statements, and uses\nthe MySQL wire protocol.\n\nSee also\nSupported SQL Functions and Operators\n\n\n\nInstallation\nInstall the C Authentication Plugin\nInstall the JDBC Authentication Plugin\n\n\nSchema Configuration\nUsing the MongoDB Connector for BI\nConnect from the MySQL Client\nConnect from Tableau Desktop\n\n\nComponents\nmongodrdl\nmongosqld\nC Authentication Plugin\nJDBC Authentication Plugin\n\n\nFAQ\nRelease Notes\nSupported SQL Functions and Operators\n\n\n\n\n",

It does not store any data itself.\nWhen starting mongosqld, you provide it a\nDRDL file describing the schema of your\ndata.\n\n\nHow are queries processed?\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI constructs an aggregation\npipeline that allows the MongoDB server to execute many SQL\nexpressions.\nmongosqld always enables the\naggregate allowDiskUse\noption.\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI cannot map some supported SQL constructs into an\naggregation equivalent. In this case, the MongoDB Connector for BI will execute those\nconstructs in memory.\n\n\nHow do I skip data incompatible with my DRDL type definition?\u00b6\n\nUsing MongoDB 3.4 Views\u00b6\nMongoDB 3.4 introduces Read-Only Views that you can\nuse to filter incompatible data.\nFor example, you can create a view in the test database that contains\nonly documents containing a number in the grade field of a grades\ncollection:\ndb.runCommand( { create: \"numericGrades\", viewOn: \"grades\", pipeline: [ { \"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } } } ] } )\n\n\nYou can then use mongodrdl to generate a schema from this view\nas you would a collection:\nmongodrdl -d test -c numericGrades\n\n\n\n\nUsing a DRDL Filter\u00b6\nIf documents in a collection contain different data types for a field,\nyou may filter for a specific data type. To accomplish this, you can\ninclude a $match stage at the beginning of the pipeline in\nyour DRDL table definition.\nFor example, to match only documents containing a number in the grade field,\nuse the following pipeline stage:\n\"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } }\n\n\nIf you are unwinding an array field that contains\ndifferent data types, then to filter the array for a specific data type, put\nthe $match stage after the $unwind.\n\nSee also\nHeterogeneous data types\n\n\n\n\nIs there any syntax validation tool for DRDL?\u00b6\nDRDL files use the YAML syntax. Any\nYAML validator such as https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/ can help you\ncheck your DRDL files.\n\n\nHow does the MongoDB Connector for BI process dates?\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI will correctly process BSON date data\nby mapping it to the SQL datetime type. For example:\ndb.data.save({ date: new Date() })\n\n\nIf you store date data as a string, the MongoDB Connector for BI treats it as a string\nrather than as a date. For example, MongoDB Connector for BI treats the following as a\nstring:\ndb.data.save({ date: '32-FEB-2015' })\n\n\n\n\nHow do I use TLS/SSL with the MongoDB Connector for BI?\u00b6\nThe connection between mongosqld and your MongoDB deployment\nhas TLS/SSL configured separately from the connection between your MySQL\nclient and mongosqld.\n\nConnecting mongosqld to MongoDB\u00b6\nIf the MongoDB instance you are connecting to uses\nTLS/SSL, provide\nthe --mongo-ssl option to mongosqld.\nFor example:\nmongosqld --schema=schema.drdl --mongo-ssl\n\n\nTo specify a TLS/SSL CA root certificate, use the --mongo-sslCAFile\noption. To specify a client certificate, use the --mongo-sslPEMKeyFile\noption. For example:\nmongosqld --schema=schema.drdl \\\n          --mongo-ssl \\\n          --mongo-sslCAFile=/certs/ca.pem \\\n          --mongo-sslPEMKeyFile=/certs/mongodb_client.pem\n\n\n\n\nConnecting a client to mongosqld\u00b6\nTo specify a TLS/SSL CA root certificate, use the --sslCAFile\noption. To specify a client certificate, use the --sslPEMKeyFile\noption. For example:\nmongosqld --schema=schema.drdl \\\n          --sslCAFile=/certs/ca.pem \\\n          --sslPEMKeyFile=/certs/mysql_client.pem\n\n\n\n\n",

The\nmongosql_auth plugin allows you to use MongoDB Connector for BI with a MongoDB\ninstance running with authentication enabled without needing to\ngenerate your own SSL certificates for authentication.\nThis plugin supports the following authentication mechanisms:\n\nSCRAM-SHA-1\nPLAIN\n\n\nSupported Platforms\u00b6\nThe plugin is built and tested on the following platforms (all x86_64):\n\nWindows 2008 R2\nOSX 10.12\nUbuntu 14.04\nRHEL 7.0\n\nThe plugin is built against MySQL 5.7.18 Community Edition (64-bit),\nand tested with MySQL 5.7.18 Community Edition and the MongoDB\nConnector for BI 2.2.\n\n\nInstall\u00b6\n\nWindows\u00b6\n\nDownload the MySQL 5.7.18 installer and install the\nproducts needed.\nDownload the mongosql_auth plugin component .msi installer and install the\nmongosql_auth plugin component.\n\n\n\nMacOS and Linux\u00b6\n\nDownload mongosql_auth plugin library from  the\nreleases page.\n\nAfter downloading, move the file mongosql_auth.so to either:\n\n<mysql-home>/lib/plugin/ directory.\nThe default location of <mysql-home> varies by platform.\nTo discover the location of the plugin directory, run the\nfollowing at the command line:\nmysql_config --plugindir\n\n\n\n\n- OR -\n\nA directory of your choice if you provide the\nplugin-dir=<your-install-dir> option to your MySQL client. See\nthe mysql client command example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\u00b6\nThe exact procedure for using the C Authentication plugin library\nvaries depending on your SQL client.\nThis plugin can be used with the 64-bsit version of the the MySQL shell\nand the MySQL ODBC driver.\n\nmysql Options\u00b6\nThe following table lists some mysql command-line options available for\nuse with mongosql_auth. For a complete list of command line\noptions, refer to the MySQL client documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nValue\nNotes\n\n\n\n--default-auth\nmongosql_auth\nUse the C Authentication plugin. You can specify the plugin\nas part of your command, include it as a ODBC\nConnection Parameter, or include it in a\nMySQL Configuration File.\n\n--user\n<your-username>\nPossible parameters to this option are\nsource=<authenticated-db> and\nmechanism=<auth-mechanism>. If no authenticated database\nis specified, it defaults to admin. If no authentication\nmechanism is specified, it defaults to SCRAM-SHA-1.\n\nNote\nIf you use both the source and mechanism parameters,\nseparate them with a & and enclose the entire option in\nsingle quotes. See the example command below.\n\n\n\n-p\nNone, shell will prompt\nRequired.\n\n--plugin-dir\n<your-plugin-dir>\nOptional. Defaults to <mysql-home>/lib/plugin/.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Command\u00b6\nmysql '--user=myTestUser?source=test&mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1' --default-auth=mongosql_auth --plugin-dir=/usr/bin/mysql/plugins -p\n\n\nThe above command specifies the user with username myTestUser\nwho is authenticated for the database test. The shell will prompt\nthe user for a password.\n\n\nODBC Connection Parameter\u00b6\nIf you are using the MySQL ODBC driver, the interface you use to\nconfigure your DSN may provide a\nfield where you can specify the default authentication\nplugin to use. Specifying mongosql_auth here will cause the\nODBC driver to use the mongosql_auth plugin by default.\n\n\nConfiguration File\u00b6\nMySQL configuration files can be found in many locations, as listed\nin the MySQL documentation.\nIn one of these files, add a line with default-auth=mongosql_auth to\nthe [client] section or create it if it does not yet exist.\nTo use this same configuration file with an ODBC DSN, provide the USE_MYCNF=1 connection parameter\nto your ODBC DSN.\n\n\n\nExample Steps: Using the C Authentication Plugin\u00b6\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet set up authenticated users for MongoDB, do that\nfirst. See Enable Authentication for more information.\n\nStart a mongod instance with the --auth option. See\nAuthentication for more\ninformation about starting mongod with security enabled.\n\nStart mongosqld with the --auth option. See\nInstallation for more information about starting mongosqld.\nmongosqld --schema schema.drdl --auth\n\n\n\nConnect to mongosqld with your client program, using the\ndefault-auth=mongosql_auth option. The connection command\nvaries by client, but with the MySQL shell the command is as\nfollows:\nmysql --user=<username>?source=<some-db> --default-auth=mongosql_auth -p\n\n\n\n\nIn the above command, <some-db> should be the database for which\nthe user is authenticated. The shell will prompt the user for a password.\nSee the table above for\nadditional options.\n\n\nNotes\u00b6\n\nThe SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism hashes the passwords in the client\nplugin; however, all other data is in cleartext. If possible, use\nwith encrypted connections.\nThe PLAIN mechanism sends the password in cleartext. As such, if\npossible, you should only use with encrypted connections.\n\n\n",

You can also use PLAIN\nfor authenticating in-database users. PLAIN transmits\npasswords in plain text. This mechanism is available only in\nMongoDB Enterprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Filters\u00b6\nYou can add a special field to your schema to pass a custom\nMongoDB $match query string to your MongoDB instance.\nUse the --customFilterField option with mongodrdl to name\na custom filter field. This field passes a native MongoDB\n$match stage to use as the first stage of the aggregation\npipeline. The MongoDB Connector for BI applies this stage before any additional stages\npushed down from SQL.\nThe query can refer to any field in the collection, even if the fields\nwere not exposed in the relational schema.\nFor an example, see Custom Filter.\n\n\n\nUsage\u00b6\n\nGenerate a Schema\u00b6\nGiven documents of the following shape in the collection abc in the\ndatabase test:\n{\n    \"_id\": ObjectId(),\n    \"close\": 7.45,\n    \"detail\": { \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3 }\n}\n\n\nYou can use mongodrdl to generate a schema based on this collection\nby running the following command:\nmongodrdl -d test -c abc -o schema.drdl\n\n\nThe generated schema file schema.drdl will look similar to the following:\nschema:\n- db: test\n  tables:\n  - table: abc\n    collection: abc\n    pipeline: []\n    columns:\n    - Name: _id\n      MongoType: bson.ObjectId\n      SqlName: _id\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: close\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: close\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: detail.a\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: detail.a\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: detail.b\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: detail.b\n      SqlType: numeric\n\n\n\n\nCustom Filter\u00b6\nTo use this field, specify the --customFilterField flag with the name you\nwant this field to have:\nmongodrdl [ other options ] --customFilterField \"_MONGOFILTER\" -o schema.drdl\n\n\nYour DRDL file schema.drdl will include the following field in every generated table:\n- name: _MONGOFILTER\n  mongotype: mongo.Filter\n  sqltype: varchar\n\n\nTo add the special MongoDB query stage to your standard SQL, use the following\nSQL syntax:\nSELECT <normal>\n   FROM <tablename>\n   WHERE <normal conditions> AND\n       \"_MONGOFILTER\"='{ <json string that represents query to use> }'\n\nSELECT name,age\n  FROM users\n  WHERE active='t' AND\n    \"_MONGOFILTER\"='{\"addr\":{\"$elemMatch\":{\"city\":\"Springfield\",\"state\":\"CA\"}}}'\n\n\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI will translate the above SQL into the following MongoDB\naggregation expression:\ndb.users.aggregate([\n   {$match:{\"addr\":{\"$elemMatch\":{\"city\":\"Springfield\",\"state\":\"CA\"}}},\n   {$match:{\"active\":true}},\n   {$project:{\"name\":1, \"age\":1}}\n]);\n\n\nYou can use this custom filter in any business intelligence tool by filtering\non your special field and providing the value to match as a single quoted string\nrepresenting valid JSON. All quotes inside the JSON must be double\nquotes.\n\nSee also\nMongoDB Connector for BI\n\n\n\n\nUsage with Atlas\u00b6\nAtlas is a cloud service for\nrunning, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments, including the\nprovisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB instances.\nTo create a DRDL file from an Atlas database, use the\nfollowing command format:\nmongodrdl --host <domain0>.mongodb.net:27017,<domain1>.mongodb.net:27017,... -u <username> -p <password> --ssl --authenticationDatabase=admin -d <database>\n\n\n\n",

you wish to specify a configuration file which saves logs to\n/var/log/mongosqld.log and loads a schema from /var/schema.drdl,\nyou may save a file such as the following to /etc/mongosqld.conf:\nsystemLog:\n  path: /var/log/mongosqld.log\nschema:\n  path: \"/var/schema.drdl\"\n\n\nYou may then start mongosqld with the --config\noption:\nmongosqld --config /etc/mongosqld.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage with Atlas\u00b6\nAtlas is a cloud service for\nrunning, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments, including the\nprovisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB instances.\nAtlas uses TLS/SSL to encrypt connections and enforces authentication by\ndefault.\n\nNote\nWith the MongoDB Atlas free tier, MongoDB Connector for BI cannot run aggregation pipelines\nusing the allowDiskUse option. This option allows aggregation stages to\nwrite data as temporary files to disk. To review the MongoDB Atlas free\ntier constraints, see the MongoDB Atlas manual.\n\nTo connect the\nMongoDB Connector for BI\nto an Atlas cluster, you must provide mongosqld with a\n.pem key file.\nmongosqld can use any valid TLS certificate issued by a\ncertificate authority, or a self-signed certificate. If you use a\nself-signed certificate, although the communications channel will be\nencrypted, there will be no validation of server identity. Although\nsuch a situation will prevent eavesdropping on the connection, it\nleaves you vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Using a\ncertificate signed by a trusted certificate authority will permit your\nMySQL client to verify the server\u2019s identity.\nFor testing purposes, you can create a .pem key file named test.pem\nusing the openssl tool:\nopenssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout test.key -out test.crt -x509 -days 365 -subj \"/C=US/ST=test/L=test/O=test Security/OU=IT Department/CN=test.com\"\ncat test.crt test.key > test.pem\n\n\nStart mongosqld with the --auth and\n--sslPEMKeyFile options.\nIf you named your key file test.pem as in the previous example, you\ncan run the following, substituting your schema file and\ncluster URI:\n\nNote\nDo not specify a username and password in --mongo-uri. The\nconnection string should only contain the list of servers.\n\nmongosqld --mongo-ssl --auth --sslPEMKeyFile test.pem --schema <schema.drdl> --mongo-uri <uri>\n\n\nPass your username, password, and authentication database to your SQL\nclient. For example, using mysql without verifying your mongosqld\nserver certificate:\nmysql --host <mongosqld-host> --port <mongosqld-port> -u <username>?source=admin -p --ssl-mode required --enable-cleartext-plugin\n\n\nRefer to Connect from the MySQL Client for more details on using the\nmysql client with the MongoDB Connector for BI.\n\n",

As\nMongoDB uses a flexible schema, these tools\ncurrently cannot use MongoDB as a native data source.\nTo use MongoDB with a relational business intelligence tool such as\nTableau, you must define a relational\nmapping for your MongoDB data.\nThe schema generation tool mongodrdl outputs such a schema in the\nDocument Relational Definition Language (DRDL) format, but you\nshould verify that the schema it proposes matches your data requirements.\nExamine both the table structure and field types to ensure that you can\ngenerate your intended reports.\nYou may have to manually edit the schema definition files to remove\nunneeded fields; add fields that mongodrdl did not discover\nwithin the subset of documents that it sampled; and modify erroneous\nfield types.\nYou may edit DRDL files to:\n\nAdd aggregation pipeline stages,\nAdd fields,\nRemove fields,\nRemove tables,\nRename tables, so long as the collection field remains the same,\nRename fields using the sqlname option\n\n\nImportant\nRestart mongosqld to apply any changes you make to your\nDRDL files.\n\n\nDocument Relational Definition Language\u00b6\nThe Document Relational Definition Language (DRDL) defines a\nrelational view of a MongoDB schema.\nmongodrdl samples documents from your MongoDB collections, and\nderives a DRDL file from those documents. mongosqld then\nuses the schema defined in DRDL files to allow MySQL clients to\nquery your MongoDB data.\n\nFile Format\u00b6\nThe DRDL file lists your databases, tables, and columns in\nYAML format.\nschema:\n- db: <database name>\n  tables:\n  - table: <SQL table name>\n    collection: <MongoDB collection name>\n    pipeline:\n    - <optional pipeline elements>\n    columns:\n    - Name: <MongoDB field name>\n      MongoType: <MongoDB field type>\n      SqlName: <mapped SQL column name>\n      SqlType: <mapped SQL column type>\n\n\n\n\nExample\u00b6\nGiven documents of the following shape in the collection abc in the\ndatabase test:\n{\n    \"_id\": ObjectId(),\n    \"close\": 7.45,\n    \"detail\": { \"a\": 2, \"b\": 3 }\n}\n\n\nYou can use mongodrdl to generate a schema based on this collection\nby running the following command:\nmongodrdl -d test -c abc -o schema.drdl\n\n\nThe generated schema file schema.drdl will look similar to the following:\nschema:\n- db: test\n  tables:\n  - table: abc\n    collection: abc\n    pipeline: []\n    columns:\n    - Name: _id\n      MongoType: bson.ObjectId\n      SqlName: _id\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: close\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: close\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: detail.a\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: detail.a\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: detail.b\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: detail.b\n      SqlType: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\nField Types\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI correctly maps fields that always contain the same data\ntype into the relational model. Schema generation deals specially\nwith the following cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI uses the most precise numeric type that matches the\nsampled documents.\nIf a field in a collection always has the same data type, the MongoDB Connector for BI\nuses that type.\nIf a field in a collection can contain either floating point\nvalues or integers, the MongoDB Connector for BI uses type numeric.\n\n\nDates\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI treats any field of type data_date as the\nSQL timestamp type.\n\nTimestamps\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI ignores any field of type data_timestamp.\n\nObjectID\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI treats any field of type data_oid as\nthe SQL type varchar.\n\nUUID\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI treats any field of type UUID as the SQL type\nvarchar.\n\nGeospatial\nIf a collection contains a\ngeospatial index, the\nconnector maps the indexed field into an array of numeric\nlongitude-latitude coordinates.\nSee Geospatial Data for an example.\nmongodrdl will currently not recognize geospatial fields\nin a read-only view.\n\n\nHeterogeneous Fields\nIf a field contains inconsistent types, the MongoDB Connector for BI chooses the most\nfrequently sampled type.\nIf a field can contain either a type or an array of that type, the\ngenerated schema always specifies that the field contains an array.\n\nSee also\nHow do I skip data incompatible with my DRDL type definition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbedded Documents\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI maps embedded documents to simple fields\nthat have a . separator character, making them appear similar to the way you\nwould reference them using dot notation in a\nMongoDB query.\nWhile Tableau properly quotes identifiers, within ad-hoc\nSQL expressions you must double-quote every identifier that contains .\ncharacters or mixed-case characters.\n\nExample\u00b6\nConsider the following document:\n{\n    \"_id\": 1,\n    \"familyName\": \"Partridge\",\n    \"hometown\" : \"Hollywood Hills\",\n    \"address\" : { \"street\": \"123 Main Street\",\n                  \"city\" : \"Hollywood\",\n                  \"state\" : \"CA\",\n                  \"zip\" : \"90210\" },\n    \"members_since\" : ISODate(\"2002-04-12T00:00:00Z\")\n}\n\n\nRunning mongodrdl on a collection containing this document\nresults in the following fields in the generated schema:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nnumeric\n\nfamilyName\nvarchar\n\nhometown\nvarchar\n\naddress.street\nvarchar\n\naddress.city\nvarchar\n\naddress.state\nvarchar\n\naddress.zip\nvarchar\n\nmembers_since\ntimestamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrays\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI exposes arrays to business intelligence tools using two\ncollections: one without the array, and the other having one document\nper array element.\n\nExample\u00b6\nIf you run mongodrdl on a collection families with the\nfollowing document:\n{\n   \"_id\": 1,\n   \"familyName\": \"Partridge\",\n   \"hometown\" : \"Hollywood Hills\",\n   \"familyMembers\" : [\n     {\n         \"firstname\" : \"Shirley\",\n         \"age\" : 42,\n         \"attributes\" : [\n             { \"name\" : \"instrument\", \"value\" : \"singer\" },\n             { \"name\" : \"role\", \"value\" : \"mom\" }\n         ]\n     },\n     {\n         \"firstname\" : \"Keith\",\n         \"age\" : 18,\n         \"attributes\" : [\n             { \"name\" : \"instrument\", \"value\" : \"guitar\" },\n             { \"name\" : \"role\", \"value\" : \"son\" }\n         ]\n     },\n     {\n         \"firstname\" : \"Laurie\",\n         \"age\" : 16,\n         \"attributes\" : [\n             { \"name\" : \"instrument\", \"value\" : \"keyboard\" },\n             { \"name\" : \"role\", \"value\" : \"sister\" }\n         ]\n     }]\n}\n\n\nThis results in the following three tables:\n\nfamilies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nnumeric\n\nfamilyName\nvarchar\n\nhometown\nvarchar\n\n\n\n\nfamilies_familyMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nnumeric\n\nfamilyMembers.age\nnumeric\n\nfamilyMembers.firstname\nvarchar\n\nfamilyMembers_idx\nnumeric\n\n\n\n\nfamilies_familyMembers_attributes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_id\nnumeric\n\nfamilyMembers.attributes.name\nvarchar\n\nfamilyMembers.attributes.value\nvarchar\n\nfamilyMembers.attributes_idx\nnumeric\n\nfamilyMembers_idx\nnumeric\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can join these tables together to view the data in a denormalized\nformat. For example, you can list the people named in the above schema\ntogether with their family information using the following query:\nSELECT f.*, m.`familyMembers.firstname` FROM families_familyMembers m JOIN families f ON m._id = f._id;\n\n\n\n\nPre-Joining\u00b6\nIf you provide the --preJoined option to mongodrdl,\nthen the MongoDB Connector for BI adds the fields in the containing document to each\narray element\u2019s document, thus \u201cpre-joining\u201d the table.\nIn the previous example, the tables would contain the following\nadditional columns:\n\nfamilies_familyMembers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamilyName\nvarchar\n\nhometown\nvarchar\n\n\n\n\nfamilies_familyMembers_attributes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamilyMembers.age\nnumeric\n\nfamilyMembers.firstname\nvarchar\n\nfamilyMembers_idx\nnumeric\n\nfamilyName\nvarchar\n\nhometown\nvarchar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Filters\u00b6\nYou can add a column of type mongo.Filter to a collection in your\nDRDL file. This column type allows you to perform a custom\n$match query.\nFor example, given the following schema describing a cloud of points with\nup to three components:\nschema:\n- db: test\n  tables:\n  - table: points\n    collection: points\n    pipeline: []\n    columns:\n    - Name: _id\n      MongoType: bson.ObjectId\n      SqlName: _id\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: x\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: x\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: \"y\"\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: \"y\"\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: z\n      MongoType: float64\n      SqlName: z\n      SqlType: numeric\n    - Name: filter\n      MongoType: mongo.Filter\n      SqlName: filter\n      SqlType: varchar\n\n\nYou can select only three-dimensional points using the following query:\nSELECT x, y, z FROM points WHERE filter='{\"z\": {\"$exists\": true}}';\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Pipelines\u00b6\n\nAggregation Pipelines using Views\u00b6\nMongoDB 3.4 introduces Read-Only Views that you can\nuse to filter incompatible data.\nFor example, you can create a view in the test database that contains\nonly documents containing a number in the grade field of a grades\ncollection:\ndb.runCommand( { create: \"numericGrades\", viewOn: \"grades\", pipeline: [ { \"$match\": { \"grade\": { \"$type\": \"number\" } } } ] } )\n\n\nYou can then use mongodrdl to generate a schema from this view\nas you would a collection:\nmongodrdl -d test -c numericGrades\n\n\n\n\nAggregation Pipelines in DRDL\u00b6\nThe MongoDB Connector for BI can use aggregation pipelines as\npart of the schema to transform documents from the collection into the\nproper form for the relational tables.\nFor example, consider a simple document in the collection\nsimpleFamilies:\n{\n   \"_id\": 1,\n   \"familyName\": \"Partridge\",\n   \"familyMembers\" : [ \"Shirley\", \"Keith\", \"Laurie\"]\n}\n\n\nmongodrdl will generate a schema with the tables\nsimpleFamilies and simpleFamilies_familyMembers.\nThe table simpleFamilies_familyMembers enumerates each family\nmembers, and has the following pipeline:\npipeline:\n- $unwind:\n    includeArrayIndex: familyMembers_idx\n    path: $familyMembers\n\n\nThis pipeline uses $unwind to create a new record for each\nmember of familyMembers. The schema tracks the array index in\nthe field familyMembers_idx.\n\n\n\nGeospatial Data\u00b6\n\nNew in version 1.1.0.\n\nIf a collection contains a\ngeospatial index, the\nconnector maps the indexed field into an array of numeric\nlongitude-latitude coordinates.\n\nExample\u00b6\nGiven the following collection:\ndb.points.createIndex( { pos : \"2dsphere\" } )\ndb.points.insert({\n    pos : { type: \"Point\", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },\n    name: \"Central Park\",\n    category : \"Parks\"\n})\n\n\nmongodrdl generates the following schema:\nschema:\n- db: test\n  tables:\n  - table: points\n    collection: points\n    pipeline: []\n    columns:\n    - Name: _id\n      MongoType: bson.ObjectId\n      SqlName: _id\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: category\n      MongoType: string\n      SqlName: category\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: name\n      MongoType: string\n      SqlName: name\n      SqlType: varchar\n    - Name: pos.coordinates\n      MongoType: geo.2darray\n      SqlName: pos.coordinates\n      SqlType: numeric[]\n\n\nmongodrdl will currently not recognize geospatial fields\nin a read-only view.\n\n\n",
